		Hello! Peter here, passionate about coding. I currently work as a web developer in Cologne.
		Welcome to my personal website, where I share my <a href="/blog">thoughts</a> on
		<a href="/listening">music</a>,
		<a href="/reading">books</a>, web development and, most importantly, my journey back to
		<a href="/running">running</a>.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Right now, this site is a work in progress, so I appreciate your patience. It also serves as a
		playground for me to experiment with new ideas and concepts that I have learned from various <a
			href="/links">sources</a
		>
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I would love to hear from you! Feel free to drop me a line in my <a href="/guestbook"
			>guestbook</a
		>.
